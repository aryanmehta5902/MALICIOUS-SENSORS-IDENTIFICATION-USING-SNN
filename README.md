# MALICIOUS-SENSORS-IDENTIFICATION-USING-SNN

Designed and implemented an algorithm using a Spiking Neural Network (SNN) to detect malicious sensor nodes in network environments, emphasizing energy efficiency and computational speed.
Achieved notable accuracy of 95.89% across 25 time steps, demonstrating the robustness of the model.
 Conducted extensive performance evaluations of various optimizers, including SGD, Adadelta, Adam, and RMSProp; identified Adam as the most effective, optimizing model performance.
