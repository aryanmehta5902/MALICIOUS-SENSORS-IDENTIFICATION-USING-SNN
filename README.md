# MALICIOUS-SENSORS-IDENTIFICATION-USING-SNN
<ul>

<li> Designed and implemented an algorithm using a Spiking Neural Network (SNN) to detect malicious sensor nodes in network environments, emphasizing energy efficiency and computational speed.</li>
<li>Achieved notable accuracy of 95.89% across 25 time steps, demonstrating the robustness of the model.
</li>
<li> Conducted extensive performance evaluations of various optimizers, including SGD, Adadelta, Adam, and RMSProp; identified Adam as the most effective, optimizing model performance.
